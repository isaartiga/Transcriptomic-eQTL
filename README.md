# Transcriptomic-eQTL
## Overview
This repository contains the scripts, examples of data, and results for an eQTL analysis conducted as part of a Master's Thesis. The study focuses on investigating the regulatory effects of genetic variants on gene expression in a cohort of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls.

## Objectives
- To explore transcriptional differences between RRMS patients and healthy controls by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
- To perform stringent quality control (QC) procedures on genotyping data to ensure the accuracy and reliability of genetic variants and sample integrity for cis-eQTL analyses.
- To conduct cis-eQTL analysis using DEGs to uncover genetic variants influencing gene expression in pDCs.
- To compare the genotypic variability of key cis-eQTL-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between RRMS patients and healthy controls.
- To explore pathway enrichment to understand the functional implications of the previous findings.
- To contextualize findings by comparing results with previous eQTL studies in neurological diseases and reference genotype databases such as the GWAS catalog.
