# Transcriptomic-eQTL
## Overview
This repository contains the scripts, examples of data, and results for an eQTL analysis conducted as part of a Master's Thesis. The study focuses on investigating the regulatory effects of genetic variants on gene expression in a cohort of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls.

## Objectives
- Identify significant expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) associated with gene expression in RRMS.
- Compare genetic regulatory mechanisms between RRMS patients and control cohorts.
- Explore the biological pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying RRMS.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
